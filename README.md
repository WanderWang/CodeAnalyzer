# SimpleLanguageService [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]
> A service that parses and reflects on the AST generated by Typescript's language service.
> With it, we can extract metadata such as initialization values and types, arguments and import declarations.

## Installation
Simply do: `npm install simplelanguageservice`.

## Usage
```typescript
// A path to a file.
const filePath = "my_file.ts";

// The code contents of a file.
const fileContents = "const foo = 'bar'";

// Add a file to the LanguageService so it can construct an AST from the contents of it.
const statements = simpleLanguageService.addFile(filePath, fileContents);

// Now we can play around with it:
simpleLanguageService.getClassDeclarations(statements, filePath, fileContents);
simpleLanguageService.getImportDeclarations(statements, filePath);
simpleLanguageService.getVariableAssignments(statements);
// And so on...
```

The Typescript LanguageService is an extremely flexible and powerful tool for static code analysis.
This is a simple LanguageService provider that boils the complex information down to
more easily digestible metadata such as class props, methods, constructor arguments, imports
and exports and other stuff.

## Differences from [Prepack](https://prepack.io/)

The `SimpleLanguageService` can resolve identifiers **to the value they are initialized to**, but it
**doesn't track mutations**.

This means that if your code gradually builds up a variable, say, an ObjectLiteral, the resolved value
will be the one it is initialized to.

Consider the following two examples:
```typescript
function foo () {
		let arr = [];
		for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
			arr.push(i);
		}
		return arr;
	}
	const val = foo();
```
The value of the variable `val` will be `[1,2,3,4,5]` since this is the return value
of the function `foo`.

But:
```typescript
const val = {};
  ['A', 'B', 42].forEach(function(x) {
    var name = '_' + x.toString()[0].toLowerCase();
    var y = parseInt(x);
    val[name] = y ? y : x;
  });
```
Here, the value of the variable `val` will be `{}` since this is the value it is initialized to.
The LanguageService will not track any mutations for already-initialized variables.
